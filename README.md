Projects were completed in COMP 1210 - Fundamentals of Computing I


# Project 1 : 

  JLetter : Program that prints out the letter 'J' made up of the word 'JAVA'.  Meant to practice fundamental Java commands and formatting.

  MyLifeGoals : Program that displays short, medium, and long term goals.  Meant as a get-to-know-you exercise.
  

# Project 2 :
  
  LiquidMeasurements : Returns data for an oil company to show an amount of liquid in barrels/gallons/quarts/ounces.
  
  
# Project 3 :
  
  ExpressionEvaluator : Uses the entered data (value) to evaluate the expression.  Also returns the number of digits to the left and right of the decimal. Finally, the program formats the answer.

  MoonTrip : Uses the entered data (ticket) to return the date of takeoff, the time, the seat number, what the ticket is for, the price (incuding the discount if available), and a random prize number.


# Project 4 :
  Spherocylinder : Uses user data to determine the circumference, surface area, and volume of a spherocylinder.
  

# Project 5 :
  Spherocylinder (continued) : Implements functions to create a list of user created spherocylinders and to read data from a text file.


# Project 6 :
  Spherocylinder (continued) : Implements functions to manipulate the list of spherocylinders.  Includes menu feature to make user interaction simpler by using codes to call functions.
  
  
# Project 7 :
  Spherocylinder (continued) : Same spherocylinder program but with arrays instead of ArrayLists.
  
  
# Project 8 :
  Spherocylinder (continued) : Implements testing functions to reduce failure.


# Project 9 :
  Vehicles : Sets up classes and subclasses of different vehicles to determine their different tax rates.
  
  
# Project 10 :
  Vehicles (continued) : Calculates tax rates of different vehicles. Implements functions to read user data, generate reports, create new vehicles, and sort data.
  
  
# Project 11 :
  Vehicles (continued) : Implements test functions to reduce failure.
